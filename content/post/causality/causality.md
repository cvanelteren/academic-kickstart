 For example, listing all recent (<10years)
progress on multiscale information, on inference of relevant scales in a
data set, on complexity and entropy measures, on time series processing
(similarity indicators, forecasting), on state reconstruction in general
(we've done quite some progress since Takens-like embeddings), on
dimensionality reduction, on causality in graphs (helpful for your PhD) and
on various forms of causality in general (including, but not only, Bayesian
networks and the like), on kernels to deal with non-numeric data, on sparse
coding and phase transitions in model inference, etc. 

# Takens' theorem

In the study of dynamical systems, a delay embedding theorem gives the condition under which a chaotic dynamical system can be reconstructed from a sequence of observations of the stateo f a dynamical system. The reconstruction preserves the properties of the dynamical system that do not change under smooth coordinate changes, but it does not preserve the geometric shape of the stucture in the phase space.
